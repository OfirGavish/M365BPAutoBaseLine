# M365 Business Premium Baseline - Safety Improvements

## Recent Changes (June 25, 2025)

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Improvements for Conditional Access Policies

The following changes have been made to prevent admin lockouts and improve deployment safety:

### üöÄ Enhanced Defender for Business Integration

- **Upgraded to Enhanced Defender Script**: The main deployment now uses `Deploy-DefenderBusinessBaseline-Enhanced.ps1`
- **MDEAutomator Integration**: Added advanced automation capabilities with Live Response scripts
- **Custom Detection Rules**: Includes pre-built detection rules for common threats
- **Threat Intelligence Management**: IOC management and threat feeds integration
- **Advanced Features Control**: New `-DeployAdvancedMDEFeatures` parameter to control enhanced features

### 1. Report-Only Mode for Admin Policies

- **M365BP-Admin-Require-Compliant-Device** policy now deploys in **report-only mode** by default
- **ALL Entra ID Conditional Access policies** now deploy in **report-only mode** for safety:
  - M365BP-Require-MFA-All-Users (report-only)
  - M365BP-Block-Legacy-Authentication (report-only)  
  - M365BP-Admin-Require-Compliant-Device (report-only)
- All Conditional Access policies from the ConditionalAccess component start in report-only mode

### 2. Fixed Parameter Duplication Error

- Fixed the "WhatIf parameter defined multiple times" error
- The main script now properly handles parameter passing to child scripts
- Added proper parameter validation and handling

### 3. Enhanced Logging

- Added full transcript logging to capture all output from child scripts
- Both structured logs (`M365BP-Deployment-*.log`) and full transcripts (`M365BP-FullTranscript-*.log`) are now created
- Better visibility into deployment issues and errors

### Enhanced Defender for Business Features

The main deployment script now uses the enhanced version which includes:

```powershell
# Deploy with all advanced features (default)
.\Deploy-M365BPBaseline.ps1 -Components @("All") -OrganizationName "Contoso" -AdminEmail "admin@contoso.com"

# Deploy without advanced MDE features
.\Deploy-M365BPBaseline.ps1 -Components @("All") -OrganizationName "Contoso" -AdminEmail "admin@contoso.com" -DeployAdvancedMDEFeatures:$false
```

**Advanced Features Include:**
- üî¥ **Live Response Scripts**: Pre-built scripts for system info, threat hunting, incident response, and security audits
- üîç **Custom Detection Rules**: Advanced threat detection patterns for PowerShell attacks, lateral movement, persistence mechanisms
- üß† **Threat Intelligence**: IOC management with support for hashes, IPs, domains, URLs, and certificates
- üè• **Environment Testing**: Comprehensive MDE readiness assessment
- üì¶ **Investigation Packages**: Automated forensic data collection capabilities

### Script Consolidation and Cleanup

- **Removed**: Original `Deploy-DefenderBusinessBaseline.ps1` (basic version)
- **Using**: `Deploy-DefenderBusinessBaseline-Enhanced.ps1` (with MDEAutomator integration)
- **Main Script Updated**: Now calls the enhanced version with advanced features by default

### Conditional Access Policy Duplication Prevention

- **Smart Component Detection**: EntraID baseline now detects when ConditionalAccess component is also being deployed
- **Automatic Skip Logic**: When both components are selected, EntraID skips its basic CA policies
- **No Conflicts**: Prevents duplicate policies with different configurations
- **Parameter Control**: `SkipConditionalAccessPolicies` parameter for manual control

### 4. New Safety Script

Created `Enable-ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1` to safely enable policies after testing:

```powershell
# Show all report-only policies
.\Enable-ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -WhatIf

# Enable specific policy after testing
.\Enable-ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -PolicyNames @("M365BP-Admin-Require-Compliant-Device")

# Enable all policies (with safety prompts)
.\Enable-ConditionalAccessPolicies.ps1 -AllPolicies
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Steps

### Before Enabling Admin Device Compliance Policy

1. **Ensure Device Compliance**: Make sure your admin device is enrolled in Intune and compliant
2. **Test First**: Use the report-only mode to see which devices would be blocked
3. **Break-Glass Account**: Have a break-glass account configured and accessible
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Test with non-critical admin accounts first

### How to Check Policy Impact

1. Go to Azure AD Portal ‚Üí Sign-ins
2. Filter by "Conditional Access" status
3. Look for "Report-only" results to see policy impact
4. Verify no critical accounts would be blocked

### Recommended Deployment Flow

1. **Deploy baselines** (policies start in report-only mode)
2. **Monitor for 1-2 weeks** using sign-in logs
3. **Ensure device compliance** for all admin accounts
4. **Enable policies gradually** using the safety script
5. **Monitor actively** after enablement

## üîß Technical Details

### Log Files Created

- `M365BP-Deployment-*.log` - Structured deployment log
- `M365BP-FullTranscript-*.log` - Complete PowerShell transcript
- `M365BP-Deployment-Report-*.html` - HTML deployment report

### Error Fixes

- Fixed WhatIf parameter duplication in child script calls
- Added proper error handling for authentication failures
- Improved module installation error handling (proxy-related errors are expected)

### Configuration Changes

The following policies now start in report-only mode:
- M365BP-Admin-Require-Compliant-Device (EntraID component)
- All policies from ConditionalAccess component

**Enhanced Defender for Business Features:**
- Live Response automation with 4 pre-built scripts
- Custom detection rules for advanced threats  
- Threat intelligence indicators management
- Investigation package collection capabilities
- Advanced hunting query automation
- Bulk device management operations

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the full transcript log for complete error details
2. Verify all required modules are installed
3. Ensure proper admin permissions
4. Use WhatIf mode first to test parameter passing

## üîÑ Next Updates

Planned improvements:
- Device compliance pre-checks before policy enablement
- Automated break-glass account detection
- Policy impact simulation tools
